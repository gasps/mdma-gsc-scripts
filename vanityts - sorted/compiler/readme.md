# GSC File Compiler

## Version: 1.0.0

This was made for Plutonium r4542 since they've updated the game for most GSC compatiblity.

This script automates the process of combining multiple GSC script files into a single `combined.gsc` file. The order of files can be controlled using `order.txt`.

## File Hierarchy

compiler  
│── compile.bat  # Batch script to run  
│── order.txt  # Optional file to specify order of GSC files  
└── ..  
project  
│── root  # Folder containing GSC files  
│   ├── file1.gsc  
│   ├── file2.gsc  
│   ├── main.gsc  # Special case (skipped but logged)  
│   └── ... (other .gsc files)  
└── ..  
combined.gsc  # Output file generated by the script (one level up)  

## How to Use

1. Place all `.gsc` files inside `project/root/`.
2. (Optional) Create `order.txt` inside `compiler/` and list filenames in the desired order.
3. Run the script: cd compiler compile.bat
4. The script will generate `combined.gsc` outside `compiler` and `project`.

## Features

- Reads `.gsc` files from `project/root/`
- Writes output to `combined.gsc` (one directory above `compiler` and `project`)
- Skips `main.gsc` but includes a separator reference
- Uses `order.txt` if available; otherwise, processes files alphabetically

## Versioning

- **1.0.0**: Initial release with file ordering and `main.gsc` handling.

## Notes

- Ensure filenames listed in `order.txt` match exactly with those in `project/root/`
- If `order.txt` is missing, the script will process all `.gsc` files alphabetically

Happy scripting!
